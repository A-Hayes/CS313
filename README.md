Computer Systems

Course Description: Introduction to system support for application programs, both on single node and over network including OS application interface, inter-process communication, introduction to system and network programming, and simple computer security concepts; hands-on lab assignments. 

Notes: Main exposure to networking at server level (vs. just client level). One of the more challenging courses I've taken due to the complexities of aligning network input/output with desired information and formatting.

Run Info: Files orginally ran with g++ on command line. For /Project code, requires the running of client code on a virtual machine to simulate network transmission.
